		<h1>PhotoBlog Terms of Service</h1>
		<h3>A NOTE FROM THE OWNERS OF PHOTOBLOG</h3>
		<p>
			PhotoBlog.com is a social platform for photographers to create photo blogs and learn from one other. PhotoBlog.com was discovered while looking for an alternative to an isolated photo blog in the vast internet. So we created a portal where photographers can showcase their work in a blog format, customized to their presentation style.
		</p>
		<p>
			The platform also provides photobloggers with an instant audience for their work. No more isolated blogs with 0 comments/views! We aim to create a community/network such that after an author publishes, he or she says, "I got some good feedback/audience to my story at PhotoBlog.com." Comments posted to the blogs should be either in the form of sincere questions or responsive answers; otherwise, they are not likely to be useful. To that end, from time to time site submissions may be deleted, edited, moved, or otherwise changed in order to maintain the direction and tone that has been established for the site.
		</p>
		<p>
			We encourage the sharing of ideas and opinions on the topic of photography, but PhotoBlog.com is not an "anything goes" website. PhotoBlog.com users come from all locations and backgrounds and have diverse thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. Keep this in mind when you participate in the community, and treat others with respect. Postings that attack another person's motivation, intelligence, or character degrade the quality of the discussion and discourage thoughtful comments by others. There are many places on the internet where you are welcome to have moral or political arguments, however, in almost every case, PhotoBlog.com is not one of them. Neither is this community a place for you to harass, abuse, threaten, or otherwise bother other members, and it's not a place for you to do anything illegal. We don't want to kick you out of the community, but if you do any of these things, we will. So don't do them.
		</p>
		<p>
			We respect our users' intellectual property and claim no copyright to anything posted on the site by our users. However, as a stipulation of using PhotoBlog.com, we retain the right to keep and display anything posted by users on PhotoBlog.com as part of the site indefinitely. If you are not prepared to accept this, please do not upload or contribute anything to PhotoBlog.com.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pretty simple, right? For the longer, wordier version of these standards, see below.
		</p>
		<p style="font-weight: bold; color: black">Terms of Use</p>
